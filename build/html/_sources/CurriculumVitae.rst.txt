   Zhiwei S# , Dehong Z, **Huifeng** *et al*” has been submitted to
   `Nature Communication <https://www.nature.com/ncomms/>`__, as
   **fourth** author, I help my supervisor perform bioinformatics
   analysis.

Personal Statement
------------------

As a graduate student interested in bioinformatics, I am interested in
metagenomics, phylogenetics and biological data mining. I learned both
computer and biology knowledge during my undergraduate years, including
professional courses such as Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Data
Structures and Algorithms, Python/R Programming.

Now I can deal with NGS project independently, for common problem, I can
find the right tools in community; for specific problem, I can use
Python write scripts or pipeline to address it.

After participated several project described above, I wish I can
continue my study and research in the area of microbial ecology.
