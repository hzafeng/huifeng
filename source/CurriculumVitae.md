## Projects I participated

### Completed Project
* **Metagenomic Reconstructions of Gut Microbial Metabolism in Weanling Pigs**
Manuscript "Metagenomic Reconstructions of Gut Microbial Metabolism in Weanling Pigs. Weilan W*, **Huifeng***, Ruurd TZ, Jinshui Z#, Michael G#" has been submitted to [The ISME Journal](https://www.nature.com/ismej/), as **co-first** author, I perform bioinformatics analysis.
* **Genomic of *Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae*** 
Manuscript "Population genomics and large-scale pathotypic evaluation reveal rapid evolutionary dynamics of a bacterial plant pathogen.Jinshui Z# , Zhiwei S# , Dehong Z, **Huifeng** *et al*" has been submitted to [Nature Communication](https://www.nature.com/ncomms/), as **fourth** author, I help my supervisor perform bioinformatics analysis.

### Project in progress
* Comparative Genomics of *Escherichia coli*
* Comparative Genomics of genus *Bacillus*

## Personal Statement
As a graduate student interested in bioinformatics, I am interested in metagenomics, phylogenetics and biological data mining. I learned both computer and biology knowledge during my undergraduate years, including professional courses such as Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Data Structures and Algorithms, Python/R Programming. 

Now I can deal with NGS project independently, for common problem, I can find the right tools in community; for specific problem, I can use Python write scripts or pipeline to address it.

After participated several project described above, I wish I can continue my study and research in the area of microbial ecology.
